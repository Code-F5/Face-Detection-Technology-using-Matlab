Face Detection Technology using Matlab
Algorirthms Used as below :
I) Viola Jones Algorithm :
   Rapid computation of Haar-like features using the integral image;
   Classifier learning with AdaBoost to select the best features;
   The attentional cascade structure which rejects the majority of the sub-windows in early layers of the detector, making the detection process extremely efficient
Viola-Jones Algorithm Features :
    Feature Calculation
    Feature selection using AdaBoost algorithm 
    Attentional Cascade
